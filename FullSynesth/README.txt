The script Algorithms.ipynb allows to use the algorithms FullSynesth and NaiveSynesth to solve the Minimum Synteny SuperTree Problem for a given input. 
The simulator Syntesim can also be used to simulate an input for the problem. Event weights and stopping criterion for the simulation may be modified in the file simulate.
